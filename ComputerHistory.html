  <h1>History of HTML</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    HTML has had a life-span of roughly seven years. During that time, it has evolved from a simple language with a small number of tags to a complex system of mark-up, enabling authors to create all-singing-and-dancing Web pages complete with animated images, sound and all manner of gimmicks. This chapter tells you something about the Web's early days, HTML, and about the people, companies and organizations who contributed to HTML+, HTML 2, HTML 3.2 and finally, HTML 4.

    Java, having been developed in 1991, is a relatively new programming language.
    At that time, James Gosling from Sun Microsystems and his team began designing the first version of Java aimed at programming home appliances which are controlled by a wide variety of computer processors.
    Gosling's new language needed to be accessible by a variety of computer processors.  In 1994, he realized that such a language would be ideal for use with web browsers and Java's connection to the internet began.  In 1995, Netscape Incorporated released its latest version of the Netscape browser which was capable of running Java programs.

    CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. ... Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.
