  <h1>Origin of Baseball</h1>
  <hr>
  <p class="para-origin">

    The origins of Baseball are uncertain. Traces of a game played with a bat and a ball date back to ancient Egypt and a ball used over 2000 years ago is on display in the British Museum in London.
    Games that may recall Baseball were played in Walacchia, nowadays a part of Romania, and Russia in the 14th century. A game played with a bat and a ball was very
    popular amongst French Monks in the 1330â€™s. In the same period, a poem by William Pagula mentioned a game named Stoolball, originally played by milkmaids, who used milking stools as wickets. Germans enjoyed a game named Schlagball , that is still
    played in the Kiel area, that hosts a couple of tournaments a year.</p>

    The invention of Baseball by Doubleday was probably invented by Baseball, but there is little doubt that he contributed to the idea of the field or better known as a diamond as we know it know. The real inventor of the rules of the game is a book
    seller from New York: Alexander Cartwright, who founded a team called The Knickerbockers in 1839, wrote the rules in 1845 and organized the first game in the United States on 19th of June 1846 in Hoboken, New Jersey. The game was not the first
    played in North America, though. The first game of Baseball played in the New World dates back to June 1838 and was played in Ontario, Canada.

  <h1>Baseball of The Present</h1>
  <hr>
  <p class="para-origin">
    In a matter of years, Baseball became the first professional sport. In 1850 the National Association of Baseball Players was born, the National League was alive and kicking in 1876.

    Americans tried immediately to make it a World Game. In 1878 a professional player named Esteban Bellan introduced the game in Cuba thanks to Horace Wilson. Games were organized in Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific in 1888 and 1889. In
    February 1889 a tour organized by Albert Spalding took the game to Italy. A championship was played in England in the late 18th century.

    The game really became international in the 20th century. By 1903 in the USA the American League began challenging the National League in the World Series. Organized Baseball Leagues started spreading all over the World: 1922 in The Netherlands,
    1934 in Australia, 1936 in Japan, 1938 in Puerto Rico, 1945 in Venezuela and Mexico, 1948 in Italy.
