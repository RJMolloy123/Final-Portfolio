Surfing:
Hawaii is known for its surfing culture, which looks much different today than in the 1700’s.  For many years, Hawaiian royalty ruled the waters.  The Hawaiian society was split into two social classes, a royal class and the commoner class.  The best surfing spots were reserved for royalty and the commoners were stuck with the lesser spots.  The reason these rules were followed was because the culture believed in the code of kapu (taboos).  The code of kapu dictated everything in the islander’s lives, from what to eat to how to build a canoe or surfboard.  This code even extended to the length of the boards.
